# Linear-Regression Head-Brain-Model

HeadBrain uses machine learning concepts to predict the size of Brain in against of Head weight, we train,test, analyse and predict data from our model which is built upon the concepts of Simple Linear Regression.

Prediction is done in both the ways with and without sklearn.

## How to Get Dataset

The dataset was available on [kaggle compettion - head brain](https://www.kaggle.com/jemishdonda/headbrain).

## What is Regression?
